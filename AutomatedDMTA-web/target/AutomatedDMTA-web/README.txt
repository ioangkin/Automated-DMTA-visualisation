Web Application template for RDI projects
=========================================

This template is a combination of:
- The AngularJS Seed Template
- Bootstrap (Twitter and AngularUI)
- Adoption of Best Practices
- Some lessons we continue to learn along the way


CHANGES TO COME:
- Commentary
- This template was created manually.  It will ultimately be generated so that it typically uses the latest
  framework libraries and allows optional addition of other utility libraries such as RequireJS and UnderscoreJS
- Caching strategy: index=none, everythingElse=versioned (doesn't seem to be working at the moment)
- Testing integration
- Styling
